# Learning Through Github

### What I learned

From reading git and ["Github Fundamentals"](https://github.com/mdckendall/git-and-github-fundamentals-Ponjaf). I learned, what branches are and the purpose of using them. In addition it also showed me the markdown feature, which seem to be a very convient way to share concerns, question or ideas. 

### What doing this assignment has taught me

From playing with github, and making this file I have gotten a little more comfortable with this platform. As well learned how edit other files, so I can learn from they did. This is shown by the hyperlink I used in What I learned portion.
